👤 By Hakim Murphy

## 🚀 Project Overview

TravelTide is an e-booking travel startup known for its large inventory but facing customer retention challenges. 
This project uses unsupervised machine learning to segment customers and generate data-backed marketing recommendations 
to increase user engagement and loyalty.

## 🔧 Tools & Techniques

- Python: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn
- Feature Engineering from user behavior
- PCA for dimensionality reduction
- KMeans Clustering for segmentation
- KPI awareness: CLV, NPS, conversion rate

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Engineered meaningful features from raw user, flight, hotel, and session data
2. Identified two user groups before clustering (`user_feat_canceled`, `user_feat_graduated`)
3. Applied PCA to simplify the feature space
4. Used KMeans to cluster customers based on travel behavior
5. Derived strategic recommendations per cluster

## 📊 Key Insights

- **Cluster 0 – High-Value Occasional Travelers**: High spend, prefer comfort and perks  
- **Cluster 1 – Frequent Travelers**: Value-focused, travel often  
- **Cluster 2 – Infrequent Travelers**: Price-sensitive, low engagement
